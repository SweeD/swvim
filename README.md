# Swvim

Swvim is a little vim package. It's lightweight and rails development optimized.

## Setup

Be sure that you don't have any .vim.old .vimrc.old .gvimrc.old in your
home directory.

Then do

    git clone git@github.com:SweeD/swvim.git ~/.swvim
    cd ~/.swvim
    ./install.sh

Now you have to follow these steps to finish the installation:

    gem install vim-update-bundles
    vim-update-bundles

And now you're ready to go!
